## Summary

Collapse each AI identity from three Hive-shelf books (Identity, Journal, Collage) down to **one Identity book** organized by chapters, plus the Collage book staying separate. Add explicit chapter pointers in `UserSettings`. Move the journal from a book to a chapter, with yearly archive chapters created on rollover. Replace every `client.create_*` callsite in the provisioning code with name-scoped `find_or_create_*` helpers so re-runs never duplicate. Migration is opt-in via a new `remember_migrate` MCP tool, surfaced through the briefing's existing `setup_nudge`.

## Motivation

Three problems in the current shape, all visible on the live Hives.

### 1. Duplicate creation

`auto_provision_user_identity` (`crates/bsmcp-server/src/remember/user_provision.rs`) and `identity::create` (`crates/bsmcp-server/src/remember/identity.rs`) only check their own `UserSettings` columns before creating books and pages — they never ask BookStack "does a book named `{name} Identity` already exist on this shelf?". When a settings column gets cleared (manually, via `remember_config write`, or migration), the next call creates a brand-new book/page and orphans the existing one.

Live evidence — Pia's Identity book (`928`) on the Bee's Roadhouse Hive contains parallel sets of agent pages:

- `Agent Backup - code-writer` (1880, created 2026-04-03) and `Agent: pia-code-writer` (2059, created 2026-04-26)
- Same pattern for `cpa`, `documenter`, `receipt-scanner`, `nate-journal`, `pia-journal`, `pia-remember`, `researcher`

Six duplicate pairs in one identity book. The "Idempotent" doc-comment in `user_provision.rs:11` is technically correct against its own state but not against BookStack's state.

### 2. No structural enforcement

DTC's `Apis's Identity` book (`3062`) was set up with an empty `Agents` chapter (`3064`) — but the agent pages (`Agent: apis-remember`, `Agent: apis-journal`, `Agent Type Templates`) sit at the book root, not inside the chapter. The chapter scaffolding exists; the code that places pages doesn't target it.

There's a parallel `provision::create_page` helper that supports `chapter_id`, but it's marked `#[allow(dead_code)]` and never wired in. Pages that should live in `Agents` end up at the root; user has to move them by hand.

### 3. Journal sprawl

Each identity has a separate Journal book (Pia: 986, Apis: 3283) with monthly chapters, daily pages, no archive boundary. As the journal grows, the briefing's "recent pages" list and the semantic-search candidate pool both pull from the full history forever. There's no natural pruning point.

## Target shape

Per AI identity, on the Hive shelf:

```
{Name}'s Identity (book)                      ← the only book per identity on the Hive shelf
├── Identity page (loose at book root, no chapter)   ← manifest
├── Chapter: Agents
│   ├── Agent: {name}-journal-agent
│   ├── Agent: {name}-remember-agent
│   └── …
├── Chapter: Subagent Conversations           ← agent-to-agent transcripts
│   └── …
├── Chapter: Journal                          ← current year, daily pages
│   ├── 2026-04-27
│   └── … (flat YYYY-MM-DD pages, ~365 max)
├── Chapter: Journal Archive - 2025           ← lazily created on year rollover
├── Chapter: Journal Archive - 2024
└── …

{Name}'s Collage (book, separate, stays as-is)
Cross-Identity Collage (shared book, separate, stays as-is)
```

What changes:

- **Removed:** the separate `{Name}'s Journal` book per identity. Becomes a chapter inside the Identity book.
- **Added:** `Agents` chapter (mandatory). Agent definition pages live here.
- **Added:** `Subagent Conversations` chapter (mandatory, scaffolded empty). Future agent-to-agent transcripts go here.
- **Added:** `Journal Archive - {YEAR}` chapters, one per past year, lazily created on first archive.

What stays:

- **Collage** stays its own book. Per-identity content discovery worked well in book form and the shape doesn't conflict with the structural enforcement we want for the identity book.
- **Cross-Identity Collage** stays a separate shared book on the Hive shelf.
- **Hive shelf** stays the global root.

## Settings schema delta

```rust
pub struct UserSettings {
    // existing
    pub ai_identity_book_id: Option<i64>,
    pub ai_identity_page_id: Option<i64>,

    // NEW — chapters inside the identity book
    pub ai_identity_agents_chapter_id: Option<i64>,
    pub ai_identity_subagent_conversations_chapter_id: Option<i64>,
    pub ai_identity_journal_chapter_id: Option<i64>,

    // existing — collage stays a book
    pub ai_collage_book_id: Option<i64>,
    pub ai_shared_collage_book_id: Option<i64>,

    // DEPRECATED — replaced by ai_identity_journal_chapter_id
    pub ai_hive_journal_book_id: Option<i64>,

    // ... rest unchanged ...
}
```

`ai_hive_journal_book_id` stays in the schema as a tombstone for backward-compat reads during migration. Once data migration completes for an identity, it gets cleared and the briefing/journal logic stops consulting it.

The three new `_chapter_id` columns are required-for-write. Reads degrade gracefully when null (briefing returns `settings_not_configured` for the journal section, etc.) but writes that need to land in a chapter (`remember_journal action=write`, agent provisioning) refuse with an `error.fix` block pointing at `remember_migrate` or `remember_config write`.

`/settings` UI gets the three new fields, populated by the chapter dropdown for the configured identity book.

## Identity creation (one-shot)

`remember_identity action=create name=…` structures the whole thing in one call:

1. Find-or-create Identity book on Hive shelf (name = `{name} Identity`, dedup by exact name match within the shelf's books).
2. Find-or-create Identity page (manifest) at the book root, loose, no chapter (dedup by exact name `Identity` or `Identity - {name}` within the book).
3. Find-or-create three chapters inside the Identity book: `Agents`, `Subagent Conversations`, `Journal`.
4. Find-or-create Collage book on Hive shelf (name = `{name}'s Collage`, dedup by name).
5. Lock Identity book and manifest page to admin-only edit (existing behavior).
6. Return all IDs in `proposed_settings`:

```json
{
  "action": "created",  // or "found_existing"
  "name": "Pia",
  "ouid": "…",
  "book_id": 928,
  "manifest_page_id": 932,
  "agents_chapter_id": …,
  "subagent_conversations_chapter_id": …,
  "journal_chapter_id": …,
  "collage_book_id": …,
  "proposed_settings": { … }
}
```

The `auto_provision_user_identity` flow (per-user side) mirrors this shape: find-or-create the per-user Identity book, identity page, chapters (`Journal` only — no Agents/Subagent Conversations on the user side, those are AI-only), then return the IDs.

## Journal logic (chapter-scoped, year-aware)

`remember_journal action=write key=YYYY-MM-DD body=…`:

1. **Year-rollover sweep** (always, idempotent, cheap):
   - List pages in `ai_identity_journal_chapter_id`.
   - Group by `created_at` year (using the user's IANA timezone, not UTC — see Decisions).
   - Any year ≠ current year:
     - Find-or-create `Journal Archive - {Y}` chapter inside the same identity book.
     - `move_page` each stale page into that chapter.
   - Scoped strictly by `ai_identity_book_id` so we never pick up another identity's archive chapters.
2. Find-or-create the `Journal` chapter for the current year (defensive — should already exist from provisioning).
3. Look up an existing page in the journal chapter with name == `key`. If present, `update_page`. Else `create_page` with `chapter_id = journal_chapter_id`.

`remember_journal action=read key=YYYY-MM-DD`:

- Parse year from key.
- If year == current year: look in `ai_identity_journal_chapter_id`.
- Else: look in `Journal Archive - {Y}` chapter inside `ai_identity_book_id` (find by name, no settings column needed for archives).

`remember_journal action=search`:

- Default scope: `Journal` chapter only (current year).
- Extended scope: `--include-archives=true` flag walks every `Journal Archive - *` chapter in the identity book. Off by default to keep the briefing's recent-pages list and the search candidate pool small.

`remember_journal action=delete`:

- Same soft-delete behavior as today (`[archived]` prefix, `deleted: true` frontmatter). Works on either the active chapter or any archive.

## Migration

Two kinds, two triggers.

### Schema migration (auto, on server startup)

`ALTER TABLE user_settings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS …` for the three new chapter columns. Existing rows get NULL. Same pattern as every prior settings addition. No user action required.

### Data migration (opt-in, via `remember_migrate` MCP tool)

Runs under the user's BookStack auth — the server's embed token can't move the user's owner-only journal pages. Has to be explicit so the user/AI can choose when to pay the latency cost (potentially minutes for an identity with hundreds of pages).

#### Trigger via `setup_nudge`

`remember_briefing` runs a legacy-state detector and emits a nudge when it finds:

- `ai_hive_journal_book_id` is set AND `ai_identity_journal_chapter_id` is null, OR
- The identity book root contains pages matching `Agent: *` (agent pages outside their chapter), OR
- An expected chapter (`Agents`, `Subagent Conversations`, `Journal`) is missing from a book that has an identity manifest.

```json
"setup_nudge": {
  "show": true,
  "summary": "Identity book restructure available: 22 loose pages in {Name}'s Identity, 64 pages in legacy journal book.",
  "recommended_action": "remember_migrate action=plan",
  "two_paths": {
    "preview": "remember_migrate action=plan — dry-run, returns what would happen",
    "execute": "remember_migrate action=apply — execute the plan"
  }
}
```

#### `remember_migrate` tool

| Action | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `plan` | Dry-run. Returns a structured list of every move/create that would happen. No writes. |
| `apply` | Executes the plan. Idempotent. Returns per-step result (`moved`, `created`, `skipped`, `failed: <reason>`). Best-effort: a single failure doesn't abort the whole pass; it's logged in the response. |
| `status` | Returns "is this identity fully migrated?" — pass/fail with a per-check breakdown. |

Internally `apply` runs these steps in order, every step idempotent:

1. Find-or-create `Agents`, `Subagent Conversations`, `Journal` chapters in identity book.
2. Move agent-named pages (matching `Agent: *`) from identity book root → `Agents` chapter.
3. Move all pages from legacy journal book → `Journal` chapter in identity book.
4. Run year-rollover sweep on `Journal` chapter (any page with `created_at` year ≠ current → `Journal Archive - {Y}` chapter, lazy-created).
5. Update `user_settings`: write the new chapter IDs, clear `ai_hive_journal_book_id`.

Migration is scoped strictly by `book_id` so we never confuse one identity's archive chapters with another identity's chapters when looking up `Journal Archive - {Y}` by name.

#### Why not auto-run from briefing

Considered: briefing detects legacy state, runs `apply` synchronously, returns briefing once done. Rejected because:

- First post-upgrade briefing becomes 30s–2min depending on page count.
- Mid-migration partial failure leaves both legacy and new state populated; the briefing response can't surface that nuance well.
- Concurrent first-briefing-after-upgrade hits BookStack API limits at the same time.

The nudge-then-explicit-tool pattern keeps briefing fast, makes migration observable and resumable, and matches how `setup_nudge` already steers users to fix config.

### Legacy book disposition

The legacy `{Name}'s Journal` book becomes empty after migration but is **not** auto-deleted. Reasons:

- Deletion is destructive; BookStack's recycle bin is the user's safety net.
- Webhook-triggered re-indexing might still reference the book ID briefly.
- The user's preference (delete vs keep as a tombstone) is not something the migration tool should decide.

Migration sets `ai_hive_journal_book_id` to null, so subsequent operations ignore the book. The user can `delete_book` it manually via the BookStack UI or the existing `delete_book` MCP tool.

## Duplicate detection (`find_or_create_*`)

Three new helpers in `provision.rs`, replacing every direct `client.create_*` callsite in the remember module:

```rust
/// Find a book on a shelf by exact name match, or create it. Returns the book id.
pub async fn find_or_create_book_on_shelf(
    client: &BookStackClient,
    shelf_id: i64,
    name: &str,
    description: &str,
) -> ProvisionOutcome { … }

/// Find a chapter inside a book by exact name match, or create it. Returns the chapter id.
pub async fn find_or_create_chapter(
    client: &BookStackClient,
    book_id: i64,
    name: &str,
    description: &str,
) -> ProvisionOutcome { … }

/// Find a page inside a book or chapter by exact name match, or create it. Returns the page id.
/// Caller specifies parent via `chapter_id` (preferred) or `book_id` (loose page).
pub async fn find_or_create_page(
    client: &BookStackClient,
    parent_book_id: Option<i64>,
    parent_chapter_id: Option<i64>,
    name: &str,
    body: &str,
) -> ProvisionOutcome { … }
```

`ProvisionOutcome` adds a new variant `FoundExisting { id, name }` so callers can distinguish "I made this" from "this was already here." Useful for the migration plan output.

Match semantics: exact case-sensitive name match against the BookStack name. No fuzzy match. Description is only used at create time (existing books/chapters keep their existing descriptions).

Replaced callsites:

- `provision::create_named_book` → `find_or_create_book_on_shelf`
- `provision::create_named_page` → `find_or_create_page` (loose at book root)
- `provision::create_page` → `find_or_create_page` (with chapter)
- `identity::create` book creation → `find_or_create_book_on_shelf`
- `identity::create` manifest page creation → `find_or_create_page` (loose, no chapter)
- `auto_provision_user_identity` book/page creation → corresponding find-or-create helpers
- New: chapter provisioning in `identity::create` and the migration tool → `find_or_create_chapter`

## Decisions (with rationale)

These were left open in the design discussion. Defaults locked here; PR review can override any of them.

1. **Chapter names — literal strings:** `Agents`, `Subagent Conversations`, `Journal`, `Journal Archive - {YEAR}` (with literal space-hyphen-space and 4-digit year). Rationale: keep them readable in the BookStack UI; the year format mirrors how the user already writes archive markers. The migration tool matches by exact name, so changing these later is a real refactor — pick once, stick with it.

2. **Year semantics — local-time-in-user's-IANA-timezone, not UTC:** A user in `America/New_York` sees their `2026-01-01` journal page archive at NYC midnight, not at UTC midnight (which would be 7pm Dec 31). Rationale: the page name is `YYYY-MM-DD` — using the user's local-day boundary keeps the page name and the archive-year decision aligned. The `meta.time` block already carries the IANA timezone server-side; reuse it.

3. **Subagent Conversations chapter — scaffolded but empty initially:** No auto-write tool for it yet. Rationale: the chapter is structural; concrete write tools (e.g., `remember_subagent_conversation`) can be added in a follow-up RFC once the data shape stabilizes. Having the chapter exist now means future tools don't have to re-do the structural change.

4. **Legacy journal book cleanup — leave intact:** Migration empties the book and clears the settings pointer; the user manually deletes it. Rationale: see "Legacy book disposition" above.

5. **`auto_migrate` user setting — not added:** Migration is always explicit via `remember_migrate apply`. Rationale: data migration is observable, has cost, and a single failed page move shouldn't be hidden behind a "did it run?" boolean. Briefing's nudge does the prompting; the user/AI decides when to execute.

## Out of scope

- **Subagent conversation write tooling.** The chapter exists; the tool to write to it is a follow-up.
- **Cross-identity migration coordination.** Each identity migrates independently. If a user has multiple AI identities on the same Hive (Pia + a future second identity), each one runs `remember_migrate` separately under its own context.
- **Collage book restructure.** The Collage book stays a book. This RFC doesn't touch it.
- **Briefing chunk trim revisions.** The trim work shipped in v0.7.4 is upstream of this RFC and stays.
- **Removing the deprecated `ai_hive_journal_book_id` column.** Stays as a tombstone field for at least one minor version; removal is a future cleanup PR after every active identity has migrated.

## Implementation phasing

Three follow-up PRs, stacked, each independently mergeable:

1. **Phase 1 — `find_or_create_*` helpers + dedup at every existing callsite.** No structural change, no new chapters yet. Just stops the duplicate-creation behavior. Smallest PR; can land first to immediately solve the duplicate-pages problem on the live Hives.
2. **Phase 2 — schema additions + identity creation flow + journal restructure.** Adds the three chapter columns, wires `Agents`/`Subagent Conversations`/`Journal` chapter creation into `identity::create`, rewrites `remember_journal` to be chapter-scoped with the year-rollover sweep. New identities created after this PR land in the new shape; existing identities still work via the deprecated `ai_hive_journal_book_id` fallback.
3. **Phase 3 — `remember_migrate` tool + briefing setup_nudge detector.** The opt-in data migration tool plus the legacy-state detector that surfaces the nudge. Migrates Pia and Apis to the new shape on the live Hives.

## Open questions

None blocking. PR review on this RFC can flip any of the Decisions above; once locked the implementation phases proceed.
